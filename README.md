Sunrise-Alarm
=============

Code for an Arduino sunrise alarm system. The alarm consists of photo resistors, triLEDs, speakers, etc. When the alarm is on, a binary number is displayed via the LEDs. To turn of the alarm off, the user must input the correct decimal conversion of the binary number. Otherwise, the alarm works as any other normal alarm (i.e. displays time, snoozes, etc.).
